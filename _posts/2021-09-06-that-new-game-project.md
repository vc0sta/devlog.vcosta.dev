Well, this is my first post on this project, so I think that I should give some overview about it.. am I doing it right?

I don't have a plan on where to start neither I know what I want to achieve. I only started this project because I was playing a lot of indie games recently with my girlfriend and some friends, and it kind of started this urge to make something by myself. It's not the first time I make a game, so this time I'm trying to create a multiplayer game, cause games are better with friends and in this pandemic, there is no option besides playing online.

I'm using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), because it's freaking awesome and prototyping here is really fast, so I guess it's a good strategy to not feel bored and abandon this project (as I've already done several times before..).

I don't have anything to show on this first post, but.. everything needs to start somewhere, right? 

This week I've been focusing on getting a first server-client network communication using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnFN6YabFKg&list=PLZ-54sd-DMAKU8Neo5KsVmq8KtoDkfi4s) from Game Development Center, if you don't know his channel and want to learn some Godot, I highly recommend you to give it a try.

Oh, and I almost forgot the most important thing.. here are the repositories for both client and server projects:

ps: **BlightDoor** is just a placeholder name as I've been playing Death's Door and BlightBound when I decided to start this project.. as soon as
