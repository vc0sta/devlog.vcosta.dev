Welcome to my first attempt at creating a personal blog!

Starting from the beginning, let me introduce myself... I'm Vinicius Costa, but everyone knows me as Dime (pronounced like Jimmy), so feel free to call me as you wish.

I started this blog mostly to keep track of a small game I'm working on in my free time, but as I've been trying to put this page live, I changed my mind and broaden the scope of this to cover anything I want.

So, this is the first post and I expect to keep writing here for at least a month, especially because I'm trying to find a way not only to write down my progress but also as a way to increase my commitment to my side project.
